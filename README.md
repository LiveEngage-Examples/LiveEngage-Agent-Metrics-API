## NodeJS - Skills API Example
This is a basic example of how to connect to the Skills API in NodeJS by using the request module. The example shows how you can get all of the skills that are on your account, how to get more information for a single skill by using their id, and how to create a skill using the API. In order to run this example you will need to update the js file with your Skills API credentials.

In order to run these examples, you will need to install the request module. To install the module just run:

```sh
npm install request
```
